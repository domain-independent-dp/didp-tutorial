# DIDP Tutorial

This repository provides Jupyter notebooks to learn DIDPPy, a Python interface for domain-independent dynamic programming (DIDP), through a tutorial.

- [tsptw.ipynb](tsptw.ipynb)[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/domain-independent-dp/didp-tutorial/blob/main/tsptw.ipynb): A complete example notebook for the traveling salesperson problem with time windows (TSPTW).
- [qtsp_starter.ipynb](qtsp_starter.ipynb)[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/domain-independent-dp/didp-tutorial/blob/main/qtsp_starter.ipynb): An incomplete hands-on notebook for the quadratic traveling salesperson problem (QTSP).

## Open with Google Colab Notebook

You can open each notebook with [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/notebook) by clicking ![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg). You need a Google account.

## Open in Your Local Environment

First, you need to download this repository. If you use [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), run the following command:

```bash

```

You may also [download this repository as a ZIP archive](https://github.com/domain-independent-dp/didp-tutorial/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

To run the notebooks, you need to install [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/install). Once you are ready, run Jupyter at the repository root.
